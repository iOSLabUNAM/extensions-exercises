# Extensions exercises

## First Challenge
You made the `Department` type conform to the `CustomStringConvertible` protocol.
Refactor the type to move `CustomStringConvertible` conformance into an extension.

## Second Challenge
Give the `Int` type a nested enum with cases **even** and **odd**.
Also give `Int` a property of that type to correctly report whether an integer is even or odd.
